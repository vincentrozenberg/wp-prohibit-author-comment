# wp-prohibit-author-comment
For a specific user case I needed a way to prohibit post authors to comment on their own posts. Since the (front)post is cached I had to catch it in the fuctions.php. 


'trash' can be replaced with '0' or 'spam'. '0' sets the comment status to "to be moderated", 'spam' goes to the spam folder.
